                        The BEST cinnamon rolls in the WORLD. Big, fluffy, soft and absolutely delicious. You’ll never
                        go back to any other recipe once you try this one! This cinnamon roll recipe includes options to
                        make them overnight or ahead of time and even freeze them.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Ingredients</h3>
                    <p>FOR THE DOUGH:</p>
                    <p>¾ cup warm milk (whole milk or 2% preferred) (110 degrees F)</p>
                    <p>2 ¼ teaspoons quick rise or active yeast (1/4-ounce package yeast)</p>
                    <p>¼ cup granulated sugar</p>
                    <p>1 egg plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature</p>
                    <p>¼ cup butter, melted (I prefer salted, but unsalted works, too)</p>
                    <p>3 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting</p>
                    <p>3/4 teaspoon salt</p>

                    <p>FOR THE FILLING</p>
                    <p>2/3 cup dark brown sugar (light brown sugar also works)</p>
                    <p>1 ½ tablespoons ground cinnamon</p>
                    <p>¼ cup butter, softened</p>

                    <p>FOR THE CREAM CHEESE FROSTING</p>
                    <p>4 oz cream cheese, softened</p>
                    <p>3 tablespoons butter, softened</p>
                    <p>¾ cup powdered sugar</p>
                    <p>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</p>

                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Directions</h3>
                    <p>
                        1. Warm milk to around 110 degrees F. I like to do this by placing milk in a microwave safe bowl
                        and microwaving it for 40-45 seconds. It should be like warm bath water. Transfer warm milk to
                        the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Add in sugar, egg, egg yolk and melted
                        butter. Mix until well combined. Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough
                        begins to form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should
                        form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it's TOO sticky (meaning it's sticking to the
                        bottom of the mixer, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don’t want to use an
                        electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured
                        surface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Allow
                        dough to rise for 1 hour to 1 ½ hours, or until doubled in size. This may more or less time
                        depending the humidity and temperature in your home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. After dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a
                        14x9 inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over dough, leaving a ¼ inch margin at the far side
                        of the dough.

                    <p>
                        5. In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle mixture
                        over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        6. Tightly roll dough up, starting from the 9-inch side and place seam side down making sure to
                        seal the edges of the dough as best you can. You will probably need to cut off about an inch off
                        the ends of the dough as the ends won’t be as full of cinnamon sugar as we’d want it to be.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        7. Cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife or floss. You should get 9 large pieces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8. Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 inch baking pan or round 9 inch cake pan. (I also
                        recommend lining the pan with parchment paper as well, in case any of the filling ends up
                        leaking out.) Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30-45 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        9. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake cinnamon rolls for
                        20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to underbake them a
                        little so they stay soft in the middle, that’s why we want them just slightly golden brown.
                        Allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes before frosting. Makes 9 cinnamon rolls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        10. To make the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, butter,
                        powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth and fluffy. Spread over cinnamon rolls and
                        serve immediately. Enjoy!
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Notes!</h3>
                    <p>
                        To make overnight cinnamon rolls:
                        After placing rolls into the greased pan (after the first rise), simply cover, place overnight
                        in the fridge and then bake them in the morning as directed. I like to bring my cinnamon rolls
                        to room temperature first by leaving them on the counter for 30-45 minutes before baking (this
                        is known as the second rise).
