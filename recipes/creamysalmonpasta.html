                    <p class="text-recipe">
                        This 30-minute salmon pasta with a creamy garlic sauce is quick and makes an easy and impressive
                        meal! It has restaurant flair that you can duplicate in your own kitchen. This is one of those
                        dishes that tastes like a lot of effort was put in, but it's actually simple enough to make
                        without a lot of fuss when you're starving after a long day at work. Quickly pan searing salmon
                        makes it extra tasty!
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Ingredients</h3>
                    <p>8 ounces spaghetti or other pasta</p>
                    <p>1/2 pound fresh salmon</p>
                    <p>1/4 teaspoon onion powder </p>
                    <p>Salt & pepper</p>
                    <p>1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
                    <p>1 tablespoon butter</p>
                    <p>1 tablespoon flour</p>
                    <p>3 cloves garlic</p>
                    <p>1/2 cup dry white wine or chicken broth</p>
                    <p>3/4 cup heavy/whipping cream</p>
                    <p>Juice from 1/2 medium lemon (about 1 tbsp)</p>
                    <p>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</p>
                    <p>1 tablespoon fresh parsley</p>

                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Directions</h3>
                    <p>
                        1. Boil a large salted pot of water for your pasta and cook it al dente according to package
                        directions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Meanwhile, season the salmon with the onion powder and some salt & pepper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Add the olive oil and butter to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once it's hot, cook the
                        salmon for a couple of minutes on each side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Transfer the salmon to a plate and set aside.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the flour to the skillet and cook for about 30 seconds,
                        stirring nearly constantly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6. Whisk in the garlic and wine (let it bubble for 20 seconds or so), followed by the cream and
                        lemon juice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7. Once the sauce is smooth, whisk in the parmesan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8. Add the salmon back in the pan and break it up with your spoon so it's in bite-size pieces.
                        Gently mix it in with the sauce. Cook for an additional 3-5 minutes or so until the sauce is
                        thickened and salmon is cooked through.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        9. Drain the pasta and add it to the skillet, along with about 1 tablespoon of the water you
                        cooked the pasta in (or more if you want to thin the sauce) as well as the parsley. Gently toss
                        the sauce and pasta. Serve immediately with extra parmesan cheese if desired.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Notes</h3>

                    <p>1. The sauce is fairly lemony, so if you're on the fence about how much to add, halve the amount
                        of lemon. You can then always squeeze more in when you've given it a taste if you think it needs
                        more. I love the stuff, so I usually add even more than I suggest in recipes when I'm cooking
                        for myself, but it's totally up to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>2. This pasta serves 2-4 people, but you can make it with less pasta to make it even richer for
                        two people. Or up the salmon to 3/4 pound.</p>
                    <p>3. You can easily double (or triple) this recipe for when you have guests over!
                    </p>
