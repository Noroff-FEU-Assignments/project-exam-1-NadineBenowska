                        Chocolate Mousse may well be the ultimate chocolate fix! Rich and creamy, yet light and fluffy,
                        one pot is satisfying but always leaves me wanting more…….
                        This is a classic chocolate mousse made the proper French way, as served in fine dining
                        restaurants. Less cream, more chocolate, a more intense chocolate flavour and a beautiful creamy
                        mouth feel.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Ingredients</h3>
                    <p>3 eggs</p>
                    <p>125g / 4.5 oz dark cooking chocolate</p>
                    <p>10g / 0.3 oz unsalted butter</p>
                    <p>1/2 cup cream</p>
                    <p>3 tbsp caster sugar</p>

                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Decoration</h3>
                    <p>More whipped cream</p>
                    <p>Chocolate shavings</p>

                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Directions</h3>
                    <p>
                        1. For reliable results, work at a steady pace so your whipped egg whites and cream do not get
                        too warm!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Separate eggs and yolks while eggs are cold. Place whites in a large bowl and yolks in a
                        small bowl. Leave whites while you prepare other ingredients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Yolks: Whisk yolks until uniform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Melt chocolate and butter: Break chocolate into pieces and place in a microwave-proof bowl
                        with the butter. Melt in the microwave in 30 second bursts, stirring in between, until smooth.
                        (Stir in optional flavourings at this point, but read Note 6 first). Set aside to cool slightly
                        while you proceed with other steps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5. Whip cream: Beat cream until stiff peaks form, being careful not to over-whip
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        6. Whip whites: Add sugar. Beat whites until firm peaks form
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fold Together All Ingredients
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        1. Fold egg yolks into cream using a rubber spatula – 8 folds max. Some streaks is fine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Check chocolate temperature: The chocolate should still be runny but warm (min 35C / 95F;
                        ideal 40C / 104F). If too cool or thick, microwave in burst of 5 seconds at a time until runny.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Pour chocolate into cream yolk mixture. Fold through – 8 folds max. Some streaks here are ok.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Add 1/4 of beaten egg whites into chocolate mixture. Fold through until incorporated –
                        "smear" the spatular across surface to blend white lumps in – aim for 10 folds.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        5. Pour chocolate mixture into egg whites. Fold through until incorporated and no more white
                        lumps remain – aim for 12 folds max, but ensure there are no obvious egg white patches.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        6. Divide mixture between 4 small glasses or pots. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably
                        overnight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7. To serve, garnish with cream and chocolate shavings. Raspberries and a tiny sprig of mint for
                        colour would also be lovely!
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Notes!</h3>
                    <p>
                        1. Chocolate: It’s critical you use COOKING chocolate, not eating chocolate. Cooking chocolate
                        (found in the baking aisle) is made for, well, cooking with. It melts more smoothly and is
                        thinner than eating chocolate when melted. If you use eating chocolate, the chocolate may seize
                        when mixed in and you may get lumps in your mousse! Don’t risk it, use cooking chocolate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Cream: You must use full-fat cream that can be whipped – pure cream (35% fat), thickened
                        cream (35% fat) or heavy cream (35 – 40% fat). Do not use pouring cream that cannot be whipped –
                        the label will state if the cream cannot be whipped.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Chocolate Shavings: Use a small knife and scrape at a low angle on the flat side of a block
                        of chocolate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Eggs tip: It’s easier to separate whites from yolks when eggs are cold, but whites at room
                        temp fluff up better when closer to room temp. So separate the eggs when fridge cold then set
                        aside while you prep the other ingredients to let the whites come to room temp a bit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5. Beaten whites consistency: Egg whites can be beaten to: soft peaks, firm and stiff peaks. We
                        want the middle one – firm peaks. If it stands straight upright without the little hook then
                        it’s stiff, not firm (still works fine but it won’t hold up as well after a few days in the
                        fridge). If you do
                        not get any type of peaks at all, then keep beating!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6. Flavourings: such as liquor, can be added into the melted chocolate, but make sure it is at
                        room temperature other it can make the chocolate sieze. Stir it in then leave to cool per
                        recipe. You can taste it later to see if the flavour is strong enough for you – but don’t go
                        overboard otherwise you may have issues setting the mousse! Up to 1 tbsp should be fine (and
                        that should be enough!!), don’t go overboard otherwise it might affect the melted chocolate or
                        compromise how the mousse sets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7. Storage: Best within 2 days but keeps for a week in the fridge with only a slight reduction
                        in aeration.
                    </p>
