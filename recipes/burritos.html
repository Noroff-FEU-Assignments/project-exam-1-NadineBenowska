                        An everyday Beef Burrito recipe, stuffed with a simple, super tasty seasoned beef, rice and
                        other fillings of choice. These Burritos are a brilliant freezer standby because they are just
                        as good made fresh or frozen then reheated. The burrito beef filling is especially good – made
                        with a homemade Mexican seasoning that’s way better than a packet of Old El Paso!
                    </p>

                    <p>2 tbsp tomato paste</p>
                    <p>3 tbsp water</p>

                    <p>BURRITOS:</p>
                    <p>6 - 8 large soft flour tortillas or round wraps</p>
                    <p>3 cups cooked rice</p>
                    <p>3 cups iceberg lettuce or cabbage</p>
                    <p>1 cup corn kernels </p>
                    <p>1 cup black beans</p>
                    <p>3 tomatoes, deseeded and diced</p>
                    <p>1/2 red onion , finely chopped</p>

                    <p>1 1/2 cups / 150g shredded cheese of choice</p>

                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Directions</h3>
                    <p>
                        1. Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 2 minutes until onion is
                        lightly browned. Add beef and cook, breaking it up as you go, until it turns from red to brown.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Add Taco Seasoning (or use 1 packet store bought) and cook for 1 minute. Then add tomato
                        paste and water, cook for 3 minutes until the water is mostly evaporated but the beef is still
                        juicy, not dried out. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes – piping hot filling will steam the
                        burrito, making the tortilla soggy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Place a burrito on a work surface. Place 1/4 - 1/3 cup of rice just below the centre. Top
                        with 1/4 - 1/3 cup beef, then some lettuce, corn, black beans, tomato, a sprinkle of red onion,
                        coriander and cheese.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4.Fold up the bottom to cover the filling then fold the edges in (video helpful to see how to do
                        this). Roll up tightly, then wrap in foil.

                    <p>
                        5. HEATING: To warm through, pan fry (dry pan) in the foil over medium high heat for a few
                        minutes on each side to slightly crisp and warm the outside. Or for 10+ minutes on a medium low
                        heat if you want to melt the cheese. Or they can be baked at 180C/350F for 20 minutes in the
                        foil – this will warm them all the way through and crisp up the tortilla slightly. If they are
                        straight from the fridge, they will take around 30 minutes to warm through.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        6. Burritos are best served with something to dollop/dip - sour cream (or yoghurt) and some sort
                        of chilli sauce are my usual because it's easy.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Notes!</h3>
                    <p>
                        1. STORAGE/REHEATING: Burritos freeze / reheat brilliantly as long as you avoid watery
                        vegetables. The combination of ingredients I use (don't use lettuce, use green cabbage) is ideal
                        for freezing. Typically, tomatoes aren't great for freezing but because it's the only "watery"
                        vegetable and not much is used, it works great. To reheat, thaw for 24 hours in the fridge or
                        overnight on counter (as log as it's not super hot where you are) then:
                        - OVEN: reheat in oven at 180C/350F in foil for 30 - 4o min (place on tray in case there is
                        leakage) until outside is slightly crisp;
                        - MICROWAVE/STOVE: unwrap then microwave for 2 minutes then crisp in dry pan over medium heat;
                        - STOVE: Leave in foil and turn over medium heat in dry pan for 10+ minutes until crisp all over
                        (takes a while to warm all the way through).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        MORE VEGGIES / Great for Freezing: One way to pack more veggies into this and/or reduce the
                        carbs by leaving out the rice is to add veggies into the beef filling. To do this, increase the
                        Seasoning, tomato and water by 50% (use the scaler by hovering your cursor over Servings) then
                        add 3 cups of diced veggies of choice, like zucchini, carrots, celery, capsicum, corn. Use a
                        large skillet, saute these veggies after the onion, then push to the side and add the beef and
                        proceed with the recipe.
