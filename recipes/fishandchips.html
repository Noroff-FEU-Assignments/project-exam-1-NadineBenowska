                    <p class="text-recipe">
                        Classic fish and chips are a British institution and a national dish that everyone can't help
                        but love. You can buy them from one of the thousands of fish and chip shops all over the
                        country, including the world-famous Harry Ramsden'sâ€”or you can make them at home.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Ingredients</h3>
                    <p>FOR THE FISH:</p>
                    <p>7 tablespoons (55 grams) all-purpose flour, divided</p>
                    <p>7 tablespoons (55 grams) cornstarch</p>
                    <p>1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
                    <p>Sea salt, to taste </p>
                    <p>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper, to taste</p>
                    <p>1/3 cup dark beer, cold</p>
                    <p>1/3 cup sparkling water, cold </p>
                    <p>4 (7-ounce) fish fillets (thick, white fish) </p>

                    <p>FOR THE CHIPS:</p>
                    <p>2 pounds potatoes, peeled</p>
                    <p>1 quart (1 liter) vegetable oil , or lard, for frying</p>


                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Directions</h3>
                    <p>
                        1. Set aside 2 tablespoons of flour. In a large, roomy bowl, mix the remaining flour with the
                        cornstarch and baking powder. Season lightly with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Using a fork to whisk continuously, add the beer and the sparkling water to the flour mixture
                        and continue mixing until you have a thick, smooth batter. Place the batter in the fridge to
                        rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into a little less than 1/2-inch-thick slices, then slice these
                        into 1/2-inch-wide chips. Place the chips into a colander and rinse under cold running water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Place the washed chips into a pan of cold water. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 3 to 4
                        minutes.

                    <p>
                        5. Drain carefully through a colander, then dry with paper towels. Keep in the fridge covered
                        with paper towels until needed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        6. Meanwhile, lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season lightly with a little
                        sea salt.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        7. Heat the oil to 350 F in a deep-fat fryer or large, deep saucepan. Cook the chips a few
                        handfuls at a time in the oil for about 2 minutes. Do not brown them. Once the chips are
                        slightly cooked, remove them from the oil and drain. Keep to one side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8. Place the 2 tablespoons of flour reserved from the batter mix into a shallow bowl. Toss each
                        fish fillet in the flour and shake off any excess.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        9. Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        10. Check that the oil temperature is still 350 F. Carefully lower each fillet into the hot oil.
                        Fry for approximately 8 minutes, or until the batter is crisp and golden, turning the fillets
                        from time to time with a large slotted spoon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        11. Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with
                        salt. Cover with greaseproof paper (parchment paper) and keep hot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        12. Heat the oil to 400 F, then cook the chips until golden and crisp, or about 5 minutes.
                        Remove from the oil and drain. Season with salt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        13. Serve immediately with the hot fish accompanied by your favorite condiment.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Tips!</h3>
                    <p>
                        1. When making this classic version, be sure to use the freshest cod, pollock, or haddock that
                        you can find for the best results. Frozen fish is also fine, but make sure it is thoroughly
                        defrosted and dried with paper towels first.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Prepare the batter and only dip the fish at the last moment before plunging into hot oil to
                        fry. This way you will always have a light and crisp snap to the batter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Use a floury potato for the chips. The best varieties are King Edward, Maris Piper, Sante,
                        russet and Yukon Gold.
                    </p>
