                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Ingredients</h3>
                    <p>100g pancetta or bacon</p>
                    <p>50g pecorino cheese</p>
                    <p>50g parmesan</p>
                    <p>3 large eggs</p>
                    <p>350g spaghetti</p>
                    <p>2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole</p>
                    <p>50g unsalted butter</p>
                    <p>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>


                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Directions</h3>
                    <p>
                        1. Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino
                        cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper.
                        Set everything aside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the
                        boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).

                    <p>
                        5. Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        6. While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter
                        into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and
                        garlic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7. Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is
                        golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon
                        and discard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8. Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with
                        a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little
                        water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away
                        yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        9. Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over
                        later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        10. Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and
                        cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg
                        mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        11. Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t
                        want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        12. Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve
                        immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If
                        the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the
                        glossy sauciness will be revived.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="h3-recipe">Tips!</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pasta water can be dripped in as you transfer the spaghetti to the hot frying pan. Everything
                        mingles to make a light, silky smooth sauce.
